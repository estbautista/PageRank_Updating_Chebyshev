% This is the network of connections between autonomous systems of the Internet. 
% The nodes are autonomous systems (AS), i.e. collections of connected IP routing prefixes controlled by independent network operators. 
% Edges are connections between autonomous systems. Multiple edges may connect two nodes, each representing an individual connection in time. 
% Edges are annotated with the timepoint of the connection.
