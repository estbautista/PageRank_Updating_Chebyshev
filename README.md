# Local PageRank Updating via Chebyshev Polynomials

This repository complements our manuscript entitled 'Local PageRank Updating via Chebyshev Polynomials' by [Esteban Bautista](http://estbautista.com/) and [Matthieu Latapy](https://www-complexnetworks.lip6.fr/~latapy/) (Submitted to *Information Processing Letters*).

The repository provides both the experiments reported in the paper and the code to obtain them.

## Tools
Codes are written in [Python](https://www.python.org).

The studied dataset is the [Tech-AS-Topology](http://networkrepository.com/tech-as-topology.php).

## Experiments
Each experiment has its own folder which cointains the data, code, result and final figure.

The experiments are:
* *Experiment 1*: Performance gains of the proposed algorithm with respect to the alternative from scratch, as well as demonstration that the algorithm can update generalized PageRank vectors.
* *Experiment 2*: Sensitivity of the algorithm to the size of the perturbation/change in the graph
* *Experiment 3*: Comparison of the algorithm with state of the art alternatives 
* *Experiment 4*: Performance of the algorithm in a tracking scenario where a PageRank vector needs to be updated during a long period of time.
